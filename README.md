The Larson Scanner LED Simulation project is an Arduino-based simulation of the iconic Larson Scanner, also known as the "Cylon Eye." This project emulates the mesmerizing back-and-forth sweeping motion of LEDs seen in popular science fiction series like Battlestar Galactica. It brings the sci-fi vibe to life with a series of LEDs that move back and forth, creating a visually appealing animation.

Features:

LED Animation: The project features a dynamic LED animation where a series of LEDs sequentially light up and dim down, creating the illusion of a moving light.

Customizable Brightness: Users can customize the brightness of the LEDs, allowing for a range of visual effects from subtle to striking.

Realistic Animation: The animation is designed to mimic the Larson Scanner effect, creating a striking visual effect that resembles a scanning or searching motion.

Easy Setup: The code is written for Arduino and is easy to upload to compatible hardware, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced hobbyists.

Customizable Code: The project's code is well-documented and can be easily customized to adjust the animation speed, LED arrangement, and other parameters to suit individual preferences.

Usage:

This Larson Scanner LED Simulation project is perfect for hobbyists, makers, and sci-fi enthusiasts looking to add a touch of futuristic flair to their projects or home decor. Whether used as an eye-catching display piece or integrated into larger projects, this LED animation is sure to captivate viewers.
